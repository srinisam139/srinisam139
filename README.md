- 👋 Hi, I’m SHRINIVAS SAMPATH
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing Masters at RIT, NY.
- 👀 I’m interested in playing with DATA most of the times because it's ENGAGING and EDUCATING (help to learn a lot about other domains).
- 💞️ I love working in Game Analytics, Statistics, NLP and Machine Learning.
- 📫 Reach me at sm3533@g.rit.edu, srinisam139@gmail.com.
